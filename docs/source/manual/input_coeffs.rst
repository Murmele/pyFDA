Input Coeffs
============

:numref:`fig_input_coeffs_float` shows a typical view of the **b,a** tab where
you can view and edit the filter coefficients. Coefficient values are updated
every time you design a new filter or update the poles / zeros.

In the top row, the display of the coefficients can be disabled as a coefficient
update can be time consuming for high order filters (:math:`N > 100`).

Fixpoint
---------
When the format is not float, the fixpoint options are displayed as in
:numref:`fig_input_coeffs_fixpoint`. Here, the format `Binary` has been set.

Fixpoint Formats
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Coefficients can be displayed in float format (the format returned by the
filter design algorithm) with the maximum precision. This is also called
"Real World Value" (RWV).

Any other format (Binary,
Hex, Decimal, CSD) is a fixpoint format with a fixed number of binary places
which activates further display options. These formats (except for CSD)
are based on the integer value i.e. by simply interpreting the bits as an
integer value ``INT`` with the MSB as the sign bit.

The scale between floating and fixpoint format is determined by partitioning
the word length ``W`` into integer and fractional places ``WI`` and ``WF``
with total word length ``W = WI + WF + 1`` where the "``+ 1``" accounts for
the sign bit.

Three kinds of partioning can be selected in a combo box:

    - The **integer format** has no fractional bits, ``WF = 0`` and
        ``W = WI + 1``. This is the format used by amaranth as well, ``RWV = INT``

    - The **normalized fractional format** has no integer bits, ``WI = 0`` and
        ``W = WF + 1``.

    - The **general fractional** format has an arbitrary number of fractional
        and integer bits, ``W = WI + WF + 1``.

In any case, scaling is determined by the number of fractional bits,
:math:`RWV = INT \cdot 2^{-WF}`.

.. math::

    F = \frac{f}{f_S}  \textrm{ or }\Omega = \frac{2\pi f}{f_S} = 2\pi F

It is important to understand that these settings only influence the *display*
of the coefficients, the frequency response etc. is only updated when the quantize
icon (the staircase) is clicked AND afterwards the changed coefficients are
saved to the dict (downwards arrow). However, when you do a fixpoint simulation
or generate Verilog code from the fixpoint tab, the selected word format is
used for the coefficients.

In addition to setting the position of the binary point you can select the
behaviour for:

    - **Quantization:** The very high precision of the floating point format
        needs to be reduced for the fixpoint representation. Here you can select
        between ``floor`` (truncate the LSBs), ``round`` (classical rounding) and
        ``fix`` (always round to the next smallest magnitude value)

    - **Saturation:** When the floating point number is outside the range of
        the fixpoint format, either two's complement overflow occurs (``wrap``)
        or the value is clipped to the maximum resp. minimum ("saturation", ``sat``)

The following shows an example of a coefficient in Q2.4 and Q0.3 format
using wrap-around and truncation. It's easy to see that for simple wrap-around
logic, the sign of the result may change.

::

  S | WI1 | WI0 . WF0 | WF1 | WF2 | WF3  :  WI = 2, WF = 4, W = 7
  0 |  1  |  0  .  1  |  0  |  1  |  1   =  43 (INT) or 43/16 = 2 + 11/16 (RWV)

          |  S  . WF0 | WF1 | WF2        :  WI = 0, WF = 3, W = 4
             0  .  1  |  0  |  1         =  5 (INT) or 5/8 (RWV)


Summation:

Before adding two fixpoint numbers with a different number of integer and/or
fractional bits, integer and fractional word lenghts need to equalized:

- the fractional parts are padded with zeros
- the integer parts need to be sign extended, i.e. with zeros for positive
  numbers and with ones for negative numbers
- adding numbers can require additional integer places due to word growth

For this reason, the position of the binary point needs to be

  0 |  1  |  0  .  1  |  0  |  1  |  1   =  43 (INT) or 43/16 = 2 + 11/16 (RWV)
